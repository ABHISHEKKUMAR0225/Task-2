<center><h1>Asia's Largest Cattle Fair</h1></center>
<p><b>Sonepur Cattle Fair is held on Kartik Poornima</b> (the full moon day) over the months
of November and December in Sonepur, Bihar,[1][2] on the confluence of river Ganges (Gandak).
 It is also known as <b>Harihar Kshetra Mela</b>. To date, it is the<b> Biggest Cattle Fair in Asia</b> and usually lasts
 from between fifteen days to one month in duration.</p>
 <p>It was historically started during Vedic period.
 The <b>Sonepur Cattle Fair</b> used to attract traders from places as far away as Tamil Nadu and Delhi. In 2018, 
 the Fair started on the 21st of November and continued until the 22nd of December.Originally, the venue of 
 the fair was Hajipur and only the performance of the puja used to take place at the Harihar Nath temple of Sonpur.
 However, under the rule of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, the venue of the fair got shifted to Sonpur.[7] 
 The temple of Harihar Nath is believed to have been originally built by Lord Rama, on his way to the
 court of King Janak to win the hand of Mata Sita. It is further said that Raja Man Singh later got the
 temple repaired. The Harihar Nath temple, as it stands today, was built by Raja Ram Narain, an influential
 person during the late Mughal period</p>
